# autochrome

This tool downloads, installs, and configures a shiny new copy of Chromium.

It includes nifty things like:

* Turning off all those annoying auto-updaters!
* Sweet colored themes for high visibility!
* No XSS auditor!
* Automatic proxy configuration! (uses 127.0.0.1:8080)
* An annoying infobar because it doesn't check TLS certs!
* Basic integration with Burp if you install the included Burp extension

Currently, the following OSes are supported:

* macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) and higher
* Ubuntu 16.04 (and other XDG-supporting Linuxes)

You will need `ruby` version 2.0 or higher and `unzip`.  These are included in
supported macOS versions.  You may need to `apt install ruby` on Linux.

## Quickstart

1. `ruby autochrome.rb`
2. Launch Chromium.
   * MacOS: `open ~/Applications/Chromium.app`
   * Linux: `~/.local/autochrome/chrome`
3. Open the "Getting Started" bookmark.

## Installing

Execute the following command: `ruby autochrome.rb`

If you've already installed Chromium with this tool before, run `ruby autochrome.rb -c` to delete the old installation and install a new one.

If you just want to recreate the profiles without redownloading Chrome, run `ruby autochrome.rb -P`.

Use the `-h` flag to see all of the options.

The "versions" used with this tool are Chromium revisions. You can get a list of the last known good versions [here](http://chromium-status.appspot.com/revisions) (use the six-digit number after `refs/heads/master`), and you can find out what revision a given build of Chrome uses [here](http://omahaproxy.appspot.com/).

## dwalter0 Updates
The version in this repository will install on kali linux 2022.3 with the above instructions. The extension for user agent tagging in the original seemed broken to me so I made a slight change. Once you've installed autochrome, delete the Autochrome Integration extension, then enter developer mode and load the unpacked extension folder autochrome/data/extension_source/autochrome_junk_drawer. Next you'll have to open autochrome a bunch of times and open each profile and create a bookmark for each. The title for all of the bookmarks needs to be the string "Autochrome Profile Name" and the url should be the color of the profile, don't worry if it fills in http:// before hand. It might look like http://red and that's fine. It needs the bookmarks for the browser extension to differentiate between the profiles.

## Running

Once you've installed Chromium, it will be placed in the `~/Applications/` directory on OS X or the `~/.local/autochrome/` directory on Linux.

The command `open ~/Applications/Chromium.app` is one way to launch it on OS X. `~/.local/autochrome/chrome` is a way to launch it on Linux.

Once you've launched Chromium, open the "Getting Started" bookmark.

## Chrome extensions

Autochrome comes with several small utility extensions; you can add more in the
`data/extensions` directory.

The `build_extensions.rb` script will rebuild all extensions under `data/extension_source`, and the standard set of colored themes. This script uses the version of chromium installed by autochrome from the default directory. You **must** have completed the installation first.

### Settings Resetter

Makes it easy to wipe cookies or all browser history from the menu bar.

### Autochrome Integration

Adds a tag to the outgoing user agent to let Burp identify it. Menu bar icon does nothing.
